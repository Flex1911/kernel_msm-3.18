      "message": "The voter clocks which need to call enable/disable on the parent clocks inside their enable/disable. If we have the refcount at the top level, we have locking issues (grabbing a lock that\u0027s already held).\n\nWe have to move the refcounting into the individual sub clock drivers so that we don\u0027t have locking issues. Not that it makes it right/wrong, but the tegra code has refcounting at two levels -- both top and inside the \"subdriver\".\n\nAlso, your voter clocks don\u0027t allow the user to do multiple enables/disables on the same clock. This would force each individual driver to refcounting in their code instead of just having matching enable/disables and not having to worry about it.\n\nSo, can we please have the ref counts pushed in?",
