      "message": "the name implies that this function is called with a lock held, but it\u0027s not. it\u0027s called from pm.c, which isn\u0027t holding the clocks_lock.\nSo, you need to take the clocks_lock spinlock inside here as clk-\u003ecount can change.\n\nFurthermore, I\u0027m not sure the name of this function makes sense at all. It really is a \"clks_check_enabled\" or something.",
