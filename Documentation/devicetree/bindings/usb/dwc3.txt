synopsys DWC3 CORE

DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "synopsys,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device

Optional properties:
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.
 - dr_mode: When set to "host", driver executes in host-only mode. If the property is
            absent or "", the controller executes in peripheral mode. Other commonly
            found values like "otg" and "peripheral" are NOT supported.
 - snps,nominal-elastic-buffer: When set, the nominal elastic buffer setting
	is used. By default, the half-full setting is used.
 - snps,ssphy-clear-auto-suspend-on-disconnect: If present, clear auto suspend feaure with ssusb phy
   during cable disconnect.
 - snps,usb3-u1u2-disable: If present, disable u1u2 low power modes for DWC3 core controller in SS mode.
 - snps,hird_thresh: If present, will determine the value of DCTL[HIRD_Thresh] which, in turn,
	controls the UTMI sleep mechanism vs. the PHY. Default value is 12.
 - snps,bus-suspend-enable: If present then controller supports low power mode
	during bus suspend.
 - snps,lpm-nyet-thresh: If present, will determine the value of DCTL[LPM_NYET_Thres].
        If BESL value received from the host in the LPM token is less than this value we send LPM ACK to the host.
        Otherwise the device returns LPM NYET.

This is usually a subnode to DWC3 glue to which it is connected.
