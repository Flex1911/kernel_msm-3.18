      "message": "Clkdev technically allows the use of aliases. So, which one do we print? con_id could be NULL too. In fact, upstream is insisting we make it NULL for the core clocks. So the name could be NULL.\n\nWe could leave in a copy \"con_id\" in clk-\u003ename and have it repeat between clk_lookup and clk and print both here clk-\u003ename and clk-\u003edbg_name here. We will also have to check for clk-\u003ename !\u003d NULL then.\n\nI\u0027m fine with doing all that if you really want that here. Let me know what you prefer.",
