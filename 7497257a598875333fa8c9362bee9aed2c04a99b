      "message": "this is silly. We shouldn\u0027t hard code it like this. I don\u0027t like this voter mechanism. We should use clkdev to define clk duplicates for the shared clocks. Look at how Colin did shared clocks it for tegra. I like that approach much better and more extensible. To that end, i\u0027d like to rename voter to shared.

      "message": "Dima,\n\nI took a look at the latest code in your android-tegra-2.6.36 tree. Colin uses strings and we use enum list. Both the tegra code and this one need to manually add entries to a table if you want to add more voters. I\u0027m not sure it makes much of a difference.\n\nThe aggregation code is similar too. Our code does some extra short circuiting to avoid having to update the parent clock\u0027s rate since it might be a clock controlled by a remote processor.\n\nCan you mind accepting this as is?",
